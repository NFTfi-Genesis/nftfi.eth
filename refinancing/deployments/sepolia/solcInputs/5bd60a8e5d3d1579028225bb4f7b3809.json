This contract manages the ability to create NFT-backed\n * peer-to-peer loans.\n *\n * There are two ways to commence an NFT-backed loan:\n *\n * a. The borrower accepts a lender's offer by calling `acceptOffer`.\n *   1. the borrower calls nftContract.approveAll(NFTfi), approving the NFTfi contract to move their NFT's on their\n * be1alf.\n *   2. the lender calls erc20Contract.approve(NFTfi), allowing NFTfi to move the lender's ERC20 tokens on their\n * behalf.\n *   3. the lender signs an off-chain message, proposing its offer terms.\n *   4. the borrower calls `acceptOffer` to accept these terms and enter into the loan. The NFT is stored in\n * the contract, the borrower receives the loan principal in the specified ERC20 currency, the lender receives an\n * NFTfi promissory note (in ERC721 form) that represents the rights to either the principal-plus-interest, or the\n * underlying NFT collateral if the borrower does not pay back in time, and the borrower receives obligation receipt\n * (in ERC721 form) that gives them the right to pay back the loan and get the collateral back.\n *\n * The lender can freely transfer and trade this ERC721 promissory note as they wish, with the knowledge that\n * transferring the ERC721 promissory note tranfsers the rights to principal-plus-interest and/or collateral, and that\n * they will no longer have a claim on the loan. The ERC721 promissory note itself represents that claim.\n *\n * The borrower can freely transfer and trade this ERC721 obligaiton receipt as they wish, with the knowledge that\n * transferring the ERC721 obligaiton receipt tranfsers the rights right to pay back the loan and get the collateral\n * back.\n *\n * A loan may end in one of two ways:\n * - First, a borrower may call NFTfi.payBackLoan() and pay back the loan plus interest at any time, in which case they\n * receive their NFT back in the same transaction.\n * - Second, if the loan's duration has passed and the loan has not been paid back yet, a lender can call\n * NFTfi.liquidateOverdueLoan(), in which case they receive the underlying NFT collateral and forfeit the rights to the\n * principal-plus-interest, which the borrower now keeps.\n *\n *\n * If the loan was created as a ProRated type loan (pro-rata interest loan), then the user only pays the principal plus\n * pro-rata interest if repaid early.\n * However, if the loan was was created as a Fixed type loan (agreed to be a fixed-repayment loan), then the borrower\n * pays the maximumRepaymentAmount regardless of whether they repay early or not.\n *\n */\nabstract contract DirectLoanBaseMinimal is IDirectLoanBase, IPermittedERC20s, BaseLoan, NftReceiver, LoanData {\n    using SafeERC20 for IERC20;\n\n    /* ******* */\n    /* STORAGE */\n    /* ******* */\n\n    uint16 public constant HUNDRED_PERCENT = 10000;\n\n    // solhint-disable-next-line immutable-vars-naming\n    bytes32 public immutable override LOAN_COORDINATOR;\n\n    /**\n     * @notice The maximum duration of any loan started for this loan type, measured in seconds.

This contract manages the ability to create NFT-backed\n * peer-to-peer loans of type Fixed (agreed to be a fixed-repayment loan) where the borrower pays the\n * maximumRepaymentAmount regardless of whether they repay early or not.\n *\n * There are two ways to commence an NFT-backed loan:\n *\n * a. The borrower accepts a lender's offer by calling `acceptOffer`.\n *   1. the borrower calls nftContract.approveAll(NFTfi), approving the NFTfi contract to move their NFT's on their\n * be1alf.\n *   2. the lender calls erc20Contract.approve(NFTfi), allowing NFTfi to move the lender's ERC20 tokens on their\n * behalf.\n *   3. the lender signs an off-chain message, proposing its offer terms.\n *   4. the borrower calls `acceptOffer` to accept these terms and enter into the loan. The NFT is stored in\n * the contract, the borrower receives the loan principal in the specified ERC20 currency, the lender receives an\n * NFTfi promissory note (in ERC721 form) that represents the rights to either the principal-plus-interest, or the\n * underlying NFT collateral if the borrower does not pay back in time, and the borrower receives obligation receipt\n * (in ERC721 form) that gives them the right to pay back the loan and get the collateral back.\n *\n * The lender can freely transfer and trade this ERC721 promissory note as they wish, with the knowledge that\n * transferring the ERC721 promissory note tranfsers the rights to principal-plus-interest and/or collateral, and that\n * they will no longer have a claim on the loan. The ERC721 promissory note itself represents that claim.\n *\n * The borrower can freely transfer and trade this ERC721 obligaiton receipt as they wish, with the knowledge that\n * transferring the ERC721 obligaiton receipt tranfsers the rights right to pay back the loan and get the collateral\n * back.\n *\n *\n * A loan may end in one of two ways:\n * - First, a borrower may call NFTfi.payBackLoan() and pay back the loan plus interest at any time, in which case they\n * receive their NFT back in the same transaction.\n * - Second, if the loan's duration has passed and the loan has not been paid back yet, a lender can call\n * NFTfi.liquidateOverdueLoan(), in which case they receive the underlying NFT collateral and forfeit the rights to the\n * principal-plus-interest, which the borrower now keeps.\n */\ncontract DirectLoanFixedOffer is DirectLoanBaseMinimal {\n    /* ************* */\n    /* CUSTOM ERRORS */\n    /* ************* */\n\n    error InvalidLenderSignature();\n    error NegativeInterestRate();\n\n    /* *********** */\n    /* CONSTRUCTOR */\n    /* *********** */\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Sets `hub` and permitted erc20-s\n     *\n     * @param _admin - Initial admin of this contract.\n     * @param  _nftfiHub - NFTfiHub address\n     * @param  _permittedErc20s - list of permitted ERC20 token contract addresses\n     */\n    constructor(\n        address _admin,\n        address _nftfiHub,\n        address[] memory _permittedErc20s\n    )\n        DirectLoanBaseMinimal(\n            _admin,\n            _nftfiHub,\n            ContractKeys.getIdFromStringKey(\"DIRECT_LOAN_COORDINATOR\"),\n            _permittedErc20s\n        )\n    {\n        // solhint-disable-previous-line no-empty-blocks\n    }\n\n    /* ********* */\n    /* FUNCTIONS */\n    /* ********* */\n\n    /**\n     * @notice This function is called by the borrower when accepting a lender's offer to begin a loan.\n     *\n     * @param _offer - The offer made by the lender.\n     * @param _signature - The components of the lender's signature.\n     * @param _borrowerSettings - Some extra parameters that the borrower needs to set when accepting an offer.\n     */\n    function acceptOffer(\n        Offer memory _offer,\n        Signature memory _signature,\n        BorrowerSettings memory _borrowerSettings\n    ) external virtual whenNotPaused nonReentrant returns (uint32) {\n        address nftWrapper = _getWrapper(_offer.nftCollateralContract);\n        _loanSanityChecks(_offer, nftWrapper);\n        _loanSanityChecksOffer(_offer);\n        return\n            _acceptOffer(\n                _setupLoanTerms(_offer, nftWrapper),\n                _setupLoanExtras(_borrowerSettings.revenueSharePartner, _borrowerSettings.referralFeeInBasisPoints),\n                _offer,\n                _signature\n            );\n    }\n\n    /* ******************* */\n    /* READ-ONLY FUNCTIONS */\n    /* ******************* */\n\n    /**\n     * @notice This function returns a bytes32 value identifying the loan type for the coordinator\n     */\n    // all caps, because used to be a constant storage and the interface should be the same\n    // solhint-disable-next-line func-name-mixedcase\n    function LOAN_TYPE() public pure virtual returns (bytes32) {\n        return bytes32(\"DIRECT_LOAN_FIXED_OFFER\");\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * @notice This function can be used to view the current quantity of the ERC20 currency used in the specified loan\n     * required by the borrower to repay their loan, measured in the smallest unit of the ERC20 currency.\n     *\n     * @param _loanId  A unique identifier for this particular loan, sourced from the Loan Coordinator.\n     *\n     * @return The amount of the specified ERC20 currency required to pay back this loan, measured in the smallest unit\n     * of the specified ERC20 currency.\n     */\n    function getPayoffAmount(uint32 _loanId) external view override returns (uint256) {\n        LoanTerms storage loan = loanIdToLoan[_loanId];\n        return loan.maximumRepaymentAmount;\n    }\n\n    /* ****************** */\n    /* INTERNAL FUNCTIONS */\n    /* ****************** */\n\n    /**\n     * @notice This function is called by the borrower when accepting a lender's offer to begin a loan.\n     *\n     * @param _loanTerms - The main Loan Terms struct.
