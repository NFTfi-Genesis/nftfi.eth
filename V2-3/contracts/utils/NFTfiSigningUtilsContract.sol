    /**
     * @notice This function is when the borrower accepts a lender's offer, to validate the lender's signature that the
     * lender provided off-chain to verify that it did indeed made such offer.
     *
     * @param _offer - The offer struct containing:
     * - loanERC20Denomination: The address of the ERC20 contract of the currency being used as principal/interest
     * for this loan.
     * - loanPrincipalAmount: The original sum of money transferred from lender to borrower at the beginning of
     * the loan, measured in loanERC20Denomination's smallest units.
     * - maximumRepaymentAmount: The maximum amount of money that the borrower would be required to retrieve their
     * collateral, measured in the smallest units of the ERC20 currency used for the loan. The borrower will always have
     * to pay this amount to retrieve their collateral, regardless of whether they repay early.
     * - nftCollateralContract: The address of the ERC721 contract of the NFT collateral.
     * - nftCollateralId: The ID within the NFTCollateralContract for the NFT being used as collateral for this
     * loan. The NFT is stored within this contract during the duration of the loan.
     * - referrer: The address of the referrer who found the lender matching the listing, Zero address to signal
     * this there is no referrer.
     * - loanDuration: The amount of time (measured in seconds) that can elapse before the lender can liquidate the
     * loan and seize the underlying collateral NFT.
     * - loanInterestRateForDurationInBasisPoints: This is the interest rate (measured in basis points, e.g.
     * hundreths of a percent) for the loan, that must be repaid pro-rata by the borrower at the conclusion of the loan
     * or risk seizure of their nft collateral. Note if the type of the loan is fixed then this value  is not used and
     * is irrelevant so it should be set to 0.
     * - loanAdminFeeInBasisPoints: The percent (measured in basis points) of the interest earned that will be
     * taken as a fee by the contract admins when the loan is repaid. The fee is stored in the loan struct to prevent an
     * attack where the contract admins could adjust the fee right before a loan is repaid, and take all of the interest
     * earned.
     * @param _signature - The signature structure containing:
     * - signer: The address of the signer. The borrower for `acceptOffer`
     * - nonce: The nonce referred here is not the same as an Ethereum account's nonce.
     * We are referring instead to a nonce that is used by the lender or the borrower when they are first signing
     * off-chain NFTfi orders. These nonce can be any uint256 value that the user has not previously used to sign an
     * off-chain order. Each nonce can be used at most once per user within NFTfi, regardless of whether they are the
     * lender or the borrower in that situation. This serves two purposes:
     *   - First, it prevents replay attacks where an attacker would submit a user's off-chain order more than once.
     *   - Second, it allows a user to cancel an off-chain order by calling
     * NFTfi.cancelLoanCommitmentBeforeLoanHasBegun(), which marks the nonce as used and prevents any future loan from
     * using the user's off-chain order that contains that nonce.
     * - expiry: Date when the signature expires
     * - signature: The ECDSA signature of the lender, obtained off-chain ahead of time, signing the following
     * combination of parameters:
     *   - offer.loanERC20Denomination
     *   - offer.loanPrincipalAmount
     *   - offer.maximumRepaymentAmount
     *   - offer.nftCollateralContract
     *   - offer.nftCollateralId
     *   - offer.referrer
     *   - offer.loanDuration
     *   - offer.loanAdminFeeInBasisPoints
     *   - signature.signer,
     *   - signature.nonce,
     *   - signature.expiry,
     *   - loan contract address,
     *   - chainId
     * @param _loanContract - Address of the loan contract where the signature is going to be used
