This contract manages the ability to create NFT-backed\n * peer-to-peer loans.\n *\n * There are two ways to commence an NFT-backed loan:\n *\n * a. The borrower accepts a lender's offer by calling `acceptOffer`.\n *   1. the borrower calls nftContract.approveAll(NFTfi), approving the NFTfi contract to move their NFT's on their\n * be1alf.\n *   2. the lender calls erc20Contract.approve(NFTfi), allowing NFTfi to move the lender's ERC20 tokens on their\n * behalf.\n *   3. the lender signs an off-chain message, proposing its offer terms.\n *   4. the borrower calls `acceptOffer` to accept these terms and enter into the loan. The NFT is stored in\n * the contract, the borrower receives the loan principal in the specified ERC20 currency, the lender receives an\n * NFTfi promissory note (in ERC721 form) that represents the rights to either the principal-plus-interest, or the\n * underlying NFT collateral if the borrower does not pay back in time, and the borrower receives obligation receipt\n * (in ERC721 form) that gives them the right to pay back the loan and get the collateral back.\n *\n * b. The lender accepts a borrowe's binding terms by calling `acceptListing`.\n *   1. the borrower calls nftContract.approveAll(NFTfi), approving the NFTfi contract to move their NFT's on their\n * be1alf.\n *   2. the lender calls erc20Contract.approve(NFTfi), allowing NFTfi to move the lender's ERC20 tokens on their\n * behalf.\n *   3. the borrower signs an off-chain message, proposing its binding terms.\n *   4. the lender calls `acceptListing` with an offer matching the binding terms and enter into the loan. The NFT is\n * stored in the contract, the borrower receives the loan principal in the specified ERC20 currency, the lender\n * receives an NFTfi promissory note (in ERC721 form) that represents the rights to either the principal-plus-interest,\n * or the underlying NFT collateral if the borrower does not pay back in time, and the borrower receives obligation\n * receipt (in ERC721 form) that gives them the right to pay back the loan and get the collateral back.\n *\n * The lender can freely transfer and trade this ERC721 promissory note as they wish, with the knowledge that\n * transferring the ERC721 promissory note tranfsers the rights to principal-plus-interest and/or collateral, and that\n * they will no longer have a claim on the loan. The ERC721 promissory note itself represents that claim.\n *\n * The borrower can freely transfer and trade this ERC721 obligaiton receipt as they wish, with the knowledge that\n * transferring the ERC721 obligaiton receipt tranfsers the rights right to pay back the loan and get the collateral\n * back.\n *\n * A loan may end in one of two ways:\n * - First, a borrower may call NFTfi.payBackLoan() and pay back the loan plus interest at any time, in which case they\n * receive their NFT back in the same transaction.\n * - Second, if the loan's duration has passed and the loan has not been paid back yet, a lender can call\n * NFTfi.liquidateOverdueLoan(), in which case they receive the underlying NFT collateral and forfeit the rights to the\n * principal-plus-interest, which the borrower now keeps.\n *\n *\n * If the loan was created as a ProRated type loan (pro-rata interest loan), then the user only pays the principal plus\n * pro-rata interest if repaid early.\n * However, if the loan was was created as a Fixed type loan (agreed to be a fixed-repayment loan), then the borrower\n * pays the maximumRepaymentAmount regardless of whether they repay early or not.\n *\n */\nabstract contract DirectLoanBaseMinimal is IDirectLoanBase, IPermittedERC20s, BaseLoan, NftReceiver, LoanData {\n    using SafeERC20 for IERC20;\n\n    /* ******* */\n    /* STORAGE */\n    /* ******* */\n\n    uint16 public constant HUNDRED_PERCENT = 10000;\n\n    bytes32 public immutable override LOAN_COORDINATOR;\n\n    /**\n     * @notice The maximum duration of any loan started for this loan type, measured in seconds.

The borrower accepts a lender's offer by calling `acceptOffer`.\n *   1. the borrower calls nftContract.approveAll(NFTfi), approving the NFTfi contract to move their NFT's on their\n * be1alf.\n *   2. the lender calls erc20Contract.approve(NFTfi), allowing NFTfi to move the lender's ERC20 tokens on their\n * behalf.\n *   3. the lender signs an off-chain message, proposing its offer terms.\n *   4. the borrower calls `acceptOffer` to accept these terms and enter into the loan. The NFT is stored in\n * the contract, the borrower receives the loan principal in the specified ERC20 currency, the lender receives an\n * NFTfi promissory note (in ERC721 form) that represents the rights to either the principal-plus-interest, or the\n * underlying NFT collateral if the borrower does not pay back in time, and the borrower receives obligation receipt\n * (in ERC721 form) that gives them the right to pay back the loan and get the collateral back.\n *\n * b. The lender accepts a borrowe's binding terms by calling `acceptListing`.\n *   1. the borrower calls nftContract.approveAll(NFTfi), approving the NFTfi contract to move their NFT's on their\n * be1alf.\n *   2. the lender calls erc20Contract.approve(NFTfi), allowing NFTfi to move the lender's ERC20 tokens on their\n * behalf.\n *   3. the borrower signs an off-chain message, proposing its binding terms.\n *   4. the lender calls `acceptListing` with an offer matching the binding terms and enter into the loan.

The ERC721 promissory note itself represents that claim.\n *\n * The borrower can freely transfer and trade this ERC721 obligaiton receipt as they wish, with the knowledge that\n * transferring the ERC721 obligaiton receipt tranfsers the rights right to pay back the loan and get the collateral\n * back.\n *\n *\n * A loan may end in one of two ways:\n * - First, a borrower may call NFTfi.payBackLoan() and pay back the loan plus interest at any time, in which case they\n * receive their NFT back in the same transaction.\n * - Second, if the loan's duration has passed and the loan has not been paid back yet, a lender can call\n * NFTfi.liquidateOverdueLoan(), in which case they receive the underlying NFT collateral and forfeit the rights to the\n * principal-plus-interest, which the borrower now keeps.\n */\ncontract DirectLoanProRatedOffer is DirectLoanBaseMinimal {\n    /* ********** */\n    /* DATA TYPES */\n    /* ********** */\n\n    bytes32 public constant LOAN_TYPE = bytes32(\"DIRECT_LOAN_PRO_RATED_OFFER\");\n\n    /* *********** */\n    /* CONSTRUCTOR */\n    /* *********** */\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Sets `hub`\n     *\n     * @param _admin - Initial admin of this contract.\n     * @param  _nftfiHub - NFTfiHub address\n     * @param  _permittedErc20s - list of permitted ERC20 token contract addresses\n     */\n    constructor(\n        address _admin,\n        address _nftfiHub,\n        address[] memory _permittedErc20s\n    )\n        DirectLoanBaseMinimal(\n            _admin,\n            _nftfiHub,\n            ContractKeys.getIdFromStringKey(\"DIRECT_LOAN_COORDINATOR\"),\n            _permittedErc20s\n        )\n    {\n        // solhint-disable-previous-line no-empty-blocks\n    }\n\n    /* ********* */\n    /* FUNCTIONS */\n    /* ********* */\n\n    /**\n     * @notice This function is called by the borrower when accepting a lender's offer to begin a loan.\n     *\n     * @param _offer - The offer made by the lender.\n     * @param _signature - The components of the lender's signature.\n     * @param _borrowerSettings - Some extra parameters that the borrower needs to set when accepting an offer.\n     */\n    function acceptOffer(\n        Offer memory _offer,\n        Signature memory _signature,\n        BorrowerSettings memory _borrowerSettings\n    ) external whenNotPaused nonReentrant {\n        address nftWrapper = _getWrapper(_offer.nftCollateralContract);\n        _loanSanityChecks(_offer, nftWrapper);\n        _loanSanityChecksOffer(_offer);\n        _acceptOffer(\n            LOAN_TYPE,\n            _setupLoanTerms(_offer, nftWrapper),\n            _setupLoanExtras(_borrowerSettings.revenueSharePartner, _borrowerSettings.referralFeeInBasisPoints),\n            _offer,\n            _signature\n        );\n    }\n\n    /* ******************* */\n    /* READ-ONLY FUNCTIONS */\n    /* ******************* */\n\n    /**\n     * @notice This function can be used to view the current quantity of the ERC20 currency used in the specified loan\n     * required by the borrower to repay their loan, measured in the smallest unit of the ERC20 currency.

This contract manages the ability to create NFT-backed\n * peer-to-peer loans type ProRated (pro-rata interest loan) where the user only pays the principal plus pro-rata\n * interest if repaid early.\n *\n * There are two ways to commence an NFT-backed loan:\n *\n * a. The borrower accepts a lender's offer by calling `acceptOffer`.\n *   1. the borrower calls nftContract.approveAll(NFTfi), approving the NFTfi contract to move their NFT's on their\n * be1alf.\n *   2. the lender calls erc20Contract.approve(NFTfi), allowing NFTfi to move the lender's ERC20 tokens on their\n * behalf.\n *   3. the lender signs an off-chain message, proposing its offer terms.\n *   4. the borrower calls `acceptOffer` to accept these terms and enter into the loan. The NFT is stored in\n * the contract, the borrower receives the loan principal in the specified ERC20 currency, the lender receives an\n * NFTfi promissory note (in ERC721 form) that represents the rights to either the principal-plus-interest, or the\n * underlying NFT collateral if the borrower does not pay back in time, and the borrower receives obligation receipt\n * (in ERC721 form) that gives them the right to pay back the loan and get the collateral back.\n *\n * b. The lender accepts a borrowe's binding terms by calling `acceptListing`.\n *   1. the borrower calls nftContract.approveAll(NFTfi), approving the NFTfi contract to move their NFT's on their\n * be1alf.\n *   2. the lender calls erc20Contract.approve(NFTfi), allowing NFTfi to move the lender's ERC20 tokens on their\n * behalf.\n *   3. the borrower signs an off-chain message, proposing its binding terms.\n *   4. the lender calls `acceptListing` with an offer matching the binding terms and enter into the loan. The NFT is\n * stored in the contract, the borrower receives the loan principal in the specified ERC20 currency, the lender\n * receives an NFTfi promissory note (in ERC721 form) that represents the rights to either the principal-plus-interest,\n * or the underlying NFT collateral if the borrower does not pay back in time, and the borrower receives obligation\n * receipt (in ERC721 form) that gives them the right to pay back the loan and get the collateral back.\n *\n * The lender can freely transfer and trade this ERC721 promissory note as they wish, with the knowledge that\n * transferring the ERC721 promissory note tranfsers the rights to principal-plus-interest and/or collateral, and that\n * they will no longer have a claim on the loan. The ERC721 promissory note itself represents that claim.\n *\n * The borrower can freely transfer and trade this ERC721 obligaiton receipt as they wish, with the knowledge that\n * transferring the ERC721 obligaiton receipt tranfsers the rights right to pay back the loan and get the collateral\n * back.\n *\n *\n * A loan may end in one of two ways:\n * - First, a borrower may call NFTfi.payBackLoan() and pay back the loan plus interest at any time, in which case they\n * receive their NFT back in the same transaction.\n * - Second, if the loan's duration has passed and the loan has not been paid back yet, a lender can call\n * NFTfi.liquidateOverdueLoan(), in which case they receive the underlying NFT collateral and forfeit the rights to the\n * principal-plus-interest, which the borrower now keeps.\n */\ncontract DirectLoanProRatedListing is DirectLoanBaseMinimal {\n    /* ********** */\n    /* DATA TYPES */\n    /* ********** */\n\n    bytes32 public constant LOAN_TYPE = bytes32(\"DIRECT_LOAN_PRO_RATED_LISTING\");\n\n    /* *********** */\n    /* CONSTRUCTOR */\n    /* *********** */\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Sets `hub`\n     *\n     * @param _admin - Initial admin of this contract.\n     * @param  _nftfiHub - NFTfiHub address\n     * @param  _permittedErc20s - list of permitted ERC20 token contract addresses\n     */\n    constructor(\n        address _admin,\n        address _nftfiHub,\n        address[] memory _permittedErc20s\n    )\n        DirectLoanBaseMinimal(\n            _admin,\n            _nftfiHub,\n            ContractKeys.getIdFromStringKey(\"DIRECT_LOAN_COORDINATOR\"),\n            _permittedErc20s\n        )\n    {\n        // solhint-disable-previous-line no-empty-blocks\n    }\n\n    /* ********* */\n    /* FUNCTIONS */\n    /* ********* */\n\n    /**\n     * @notice This function is called by the lender when accepting a barrower's binding terms for a loan.\n     *\n     * @param _listingTerms - Terms the borrower set off-chain and is willing to accept automatically when\n     * fulfiled by a lender's offer .\n     * @param _offer - The offer made by the lender.\n     * @param _signature - The components of the borrower's signature.\n     */\n    function acceptListing(\n        ListingTerms memory _listingTerms,\n        Offer memory _offer,\n        Signature memory _signature\n    ) external whenNotPaused nonReentrant {\n        address nftWrapper = _getWrapper(_offer.nftCollateralContract);\n        _loanSanityChecks(_offer, nftWrapper);\n        _bindingTermsSanityChecks(_listingTerms, _offer);\n        _acceptListing(\n            LOAN_TYPE,\n            _setupLoanTerms(_offer, nftWrapper, _signature.signer),\n            _setupLoanExtras(_listingTerms.revenueSharePartner, _listingTerms.referralFeeInBasisPoints),\n            _listingTerms,\n            _offer.referrer,\n            _signature\n        );\n    }\n\n    /* ******************* */\n    /* READ-ONLY FUNCTIONS */\n    /* ******************* */\n\n    /**\n     * @notice This function can be used to view the current quantity of the ERC20 currency used in the specified loan\n     * required by the borrower to repay their loan, measured in the smallest unit of the ERC20 currency.
