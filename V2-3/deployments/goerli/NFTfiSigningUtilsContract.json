The borrower will always have\\n     * to pay this amount to retrieve their collateral, regardless of whether they repay early.\\n     * - nftCollateralContract: The address of the ERC721 contract of the NFT collateral.\\n     * - nftCollateralId: The ID within the NFTCollateralContract for the NFT being used as collateral for this\\n     * loan. The NFT is stored within this contract during the duration of the loan.\\n     * - referrer: The address of the referrer who found the lender matching the listing, Zero address to signal\\n     * this there is no referrer.\\n     * - loanDuration: The amount of time (measured in seconds) that can elapse before the lender can liquidate the\\n     * loan and seize the underlying collateral NFT.\\n     * - loanInterestRateForDurationInBasisPoints: This is the interest rate (measured in basis points, e.g.\\n     * hundreths of a percent) for the loan, that must be repaid pro-rata by the borrower at the conclusion of the loan\\n     * or risk seizure of their nft collateral. Note if the type of the loan is fixed then this value  is not used and\\n     * is irrelevant so it should be set to 0.\\n     * - loanAdminFeeInBasisPoints: The percent (measured in basis points) of the interest earned that will be\\n     * taken as a fee by the contract admins when the loan is repaid. The fee is stored in the loan struct to prevent an\\n     * attack where the contract admins could adjust the fee right before a loan is repaid, and take all of the interest\\n     * earned.\\n     * @param _signature - The signature structure containing:\\n     * - signer: The address of the signer.

These nonce can be any uint256 value that the user has not previously used to sign an off-chain order. Each nonce can be used at most once per user within NFTfi, regardless of whether they are the lender or the borrower in that situation. This serves two purposes:   - First, it prevents replay attacks where an attacker would submit a user's off-chain order more than once.   - Second, it allows a user to cancel an off-chain order by calling NFTfi.cancelLoanCommitmentBeforeLoanHasBegun(), which marks the nonce as used and prevents any future loan from using the user's off-chain order that contains that nonce. - expiry: Date when the signature expires - signature: The ECDSA signature of the lender, obtained off-chain ahead of time, signing the following combination of parameters:   - offer.loanERC20Denomination   - offer.loanPrincipalAmount   - offer.maximumRepaymentAmount   - offer.nftCollateralContract   - offer.nftCollateralId   - offer.referrer   - offer.loanDuration   - offer.loanAdminFeeInBasisPoints   - signature.signer,   - signature.nonce,   - signature.expiry,   - loan contract address,   - chainId"
