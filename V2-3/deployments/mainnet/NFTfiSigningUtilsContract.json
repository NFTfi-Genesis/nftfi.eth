These nonce can be any uint256 value that the user has not previously used to sign an off-chain order. Each nonce can be used at most once per user within NFTfi, regardless of whether they are the lender or the borrower in that situation. This serves two purposes:   - First, it prevents replay attacks where an attacker would submit a user's off-chain order more than once.   - Second, it allows a user to cancel an off-chain order by calling NFTfi.cancelLoanCommitmentBeforeLoanHasBegun(), which marks the nonce as used and prevents any future loan from using the user's off-chain order that contains that nonce. - expiry: Date when the signature expires - signature: The ECDSA signature of the lender, obtained off-chain ahead of time, signing the following combination of parameters:   - offer.loanERC20Denomination   - offer.loanPrincipalAmount   - offer.maximumRepaymentAmount   - offer.nftCollateralContract   - offer.nftCollateralId   - offer.referrer   - offer.loanDuration   - offer.loanAdminFeeInBasisPoints   - signature.signer,   - signature.nonce,   - signature.expiry,   - loan contract address,   - chainId"
